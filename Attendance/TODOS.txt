	- Session should calculate number of check-ins.
	- Session should start immediately once it is created and QR code appears which allow students to check-in.
	- Session can be ended manually or automatically after duration passes.
	

- Check-in Functionality:
	- When scan the QR code, student must be redirected to checkIn form page.
	- CheckIn page allows student to enter his ID and the verification code.
	- There should be a verification code.
